### SNOW PORTAL

ServiceNow portals allow you to build custom user interfaces for your ServiceNow application. This section will cover various topics in portal development. It will take a top-down approach, starting at the highest level of portal development, and work it's way down to the granular widgets. 

There is a lot you can do on the SNOW portal. SNOW is built on top of the Angular framework. The developers at SNOW opened their platform up to allow developers to write their applications in Angular. This allows for greater control in building advanced web applications on their platform. There is a caveat though. Most of the development will be familiar to you if you have built an Angular application in the past, but there are differences. We will cover all of these quirks in the Angular Quirks section.
