### Portal Theme

#### Setting up a Portal
Once you've created a custom application within ServiceNow, navigate to the dev studio. If you just started out, your studio will be fairly empty. The Studio is where you will do the majority of your development for your application. 

1. Click on the "Create Application File" button at the top of the page
2. In the **Create Application File** dialog, type *portal* into the filter
3. Select **Service Portal** and click "Create"

##### Service Portal Form
* Give a **Title** for your Portal
* Give a **URL suffix** for your Portal home page
* Select a **Homepage** for your Portal page
* If you have a **Knowledge base**, select your knowledge base
* Setup a **404 page**
* Choose your **Catalog**
* Select your ** Catalog home page**
* Select your **Main menu**
* Choose your **Theme** If you do not have a theme, create one
* Choose your **Login page**
* Upload a Logo and Icon for your portal. 
* You can setup Portal specific CSS variables on this form too. The CSS form supports SASS.

***Don't worry about setting up all of your Portal page up at the beginning. If you forget anything, you can go back and update it.***
